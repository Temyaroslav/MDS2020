    "The aggregator offers a reasonable classification of tickets based on the suggested criteria. On the bright side it uses the price of the ticket and the number of transfers as the main features to classify the offer, which are often the shaping factors when choosing a ticket. However, criteria like refund and luggage availability seem almost negligible, which is far from truth when it comes to the real life situations. \n",
    "Overall, I think that the set of criteria is rather sufficient whereas the classification rule is lacking complexity and would result in \"other\" category far too often. The proper aggregator should take into the account all the criteria given to classify the offer."

The similar goes with the ticket price, let's assume that the maximum score we can get for the ticket is 0.5 and we will deduct 0.1 per each 100\\\\$ (e.g. if the ticket price is 300$, we will get 0.5 - 300 * 0.1 / 100 = 0.2 as the ticket price score).
