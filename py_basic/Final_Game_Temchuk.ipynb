    "Welcome to Dungeons & Dragons text-based RPG game!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game you are a knight who is about to challenge his main enemy - dragon by the name of \"Dreadful Dracarys\". The idea behind the game is to develop your character up to the point when he can fight the dragon and make it out alive. If you fight the dragon and lose - it's gameover. However, you don't have the whole life ahead to develop your character: when 6 days are passed - the dragon will fly to town and fight the knight itself!"

   "source": [
    "To start the game you give a name to your knight and choose the difficulty (game mode). Difficulty will determine how powerful are the attacks of monsters in the dungeon and also how powerful is the dragon.\n",
    "\n",
    "At start the knight is initialised with the particular set of stats: Health, Stamina and Attack. Also he has the inventory which is designed to store Gold and Obsidium Ore - they are used later on to Craft the weapon, which would help to kill the dragon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dungeons & Dragons is the step-based game, so at each step there is a set of actions the knight is allowed to perform but at cost of some time passed. When 6 days are passed, you'll need to fight the dragon regardless of \n",
    "your readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following set of actions will be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Dungeon. Dungeon is the place where the knight can earn some gold. To do that he has to kill monsters. Monsters are randomly generated. There is a 20% chance to meet a Giant Troll who has more damage but also more gold, otherwise there are Filthy Goblins that you have to kill. The cost of going to the dungeon is half a day (0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "When fighting monsters you have two actions available:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1.1) Attack. Your damage depends on your character stats, each attack costs 1 Stamina and if your Stamina falls below 5, your attacks will only be half the damage. If you attack a monster, they will fight back - the damage of their attack depends on the type of monster and the game mode. You also have a 30% chance of dodging the attack, otherwise you take the damage. If you win a monster - you take its Gold. If not - it's a gameover.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1.2) Flee. If your Health gets too low, you can flee from the dungeon. This would cost you 2 Stamina points.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Mine. Mine is the place where the knight has a chance to find some Obsidium Ore needed for crafting the weapon. There is a 50% chance to find 1 Obsidium Ore every time you go to the mine. The cost of going to the mine is a quarter of a day (0.25) and 1 Stamina point.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Craft. Crafting is used to craft the Dragon's Sorrow Sword, which is very helpful when fighting the dragon - it raises your Attack stats by 3 points which highly increases your chances to win the dragon! However, to craft it you would need 3 Gold and 3 Obsidium Ore. Crafting a sword also takes a quarter of a day (0.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Sleep. Sleeping helps your knight to restore his Health and Stamina. Sleeping takes a quarter of a day (0.25) and resores 1 point of Health and Stamina. Note that you can restore no more than max Health and Stamina allowed (10 points each).\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Dragon. If you feel ready (usually when you've crafted the Dragon's Sorrow Sword), you can challenge the dragon. This is the endpoint of the game and you can either win the dragon or not. There is only one action allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "(5.1) Attack. The mechanics here are similar to attacks in the dungeon."
