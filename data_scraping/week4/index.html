       <p>
         In order to have some rest from computers we going to read
         several poems written by an american poet William Blake.
         However, this web-page originally does not look very pleasant, so
         it turns out as a good opportunity to demonstrate how few
         lines of CSS-code can change a look of the page drastically.

    <h2 id='poem_1'>Ah! Sun-flower</h2>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
         Ah Sun-flower! weary of time,<br>
         Who countest the steps of the Sun:<br>
         Seeking after that sweet golden clime<br>
         Where the travellers journey is done.<br>
     </p>

     <p>
        Where the Youth pined away with desire,<br>
        And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow:<br>
        Arise from their graves and aspire,<br>
        Where my Sun-flower wishes to go.<br>
     </p>
    </div>


   <h2 id='poem_2'>Infant Joy</h2>

   <div class="poem">
     <p>
       I have no name<br>
       I am but two days old.—<br>
       What shall I call thee?<br>
       I happy am<br>
       Joy is my name,—<br>
       Sweet joy befall thee!<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Pretty joy!<br>
      Sweet joy but two days old,<br>
      Sweet joy I call thee;<br>
      Thou dost smile.<br>
      I sing the while<br>
      Sweet joy befall thee.<br>
    </p>
   </div>



    <h2 id="poem_3">The Smile</h2>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>There is a Smile of Love<br>
        And there is a Smile of Deceit<br>
        And there is a Smile of Smiles<br>
        In which these two Smiles meet<br> </p>

      <p>And there is a Frown of Hate<br>
        And there is a Frown of disdain<br>
        And there is a Frown of Frowns<br>
        Which you strive to forget in vain<br> </p>

      <p>For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core<br>
        And it sticks in the deep Back bone<br>
        And no Smile that ever was smild<br>
        But only one Smile alone<br> </p>

      <p>That betwixt the Cradle & Grave<br>
        It only once Smild can be<br>
        But when it once is Smild<br>
        Theres an end to all Misery<br> </p>
